# TA Resources

Welcome! 

This is a repository for resources, guides, and materials useful for your TA duties in the Stats Department at UCSC. 

You can start exploring our [Wiki](https://github.com/andrew-le/TA-Wiki/wiki/Our-Role), and then contribute with materials for each of our [courses](courses.md).
